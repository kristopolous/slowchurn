This is currently just a collection of notes. I've long had this idea for a site similar to reddit/hn but the difference is

 * comments do not become live immediately. Instead they go into a 20-hour or so queue and then you have to come back later and approve them
 * you can't comment an unlimited amount. The "pending queue" has a low, finite size, let's say 10. So you can only have 10 comments every 20 hours
 * some kind of timer is enforced to only allow the user say 90 minutes a day on the site
 * there are no up and down arrows, no points, no scores. There is a flagging system for abuse and spam and that's it - nothing to gamify.

The general idea is to discourage harrassment, bullying, and what I'll call "drunk posting" by designing around the psychological hooks that lead to addictive and anti-social behavior in online spaces.  This is done by eliminating the seratonin feedback loops of the gaming patterns.

However, for the site to have sticking power there still needs to be habituation so this is designed after the daily nytimes games like wordle which essentially present you with a finite, bounded experience metered by the day.

Also if the goal is to have an increase in quality and relevance, then there should be some permalink and archival strategy unlike the disposable stream focus of feed-based sites.  

I keep forgetting and recapturing this idea and this is the place for me to write it down
